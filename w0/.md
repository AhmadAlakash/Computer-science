## what is Computer  science ? 

she is related with Problem Solving  or  she is the  Problem Solving 

![2022-11-08](C:\Users\49157\OneDrive\الصور\Screenshots\2022-11-08.png)

we have problem from ex  user and she came as input  of the computer  , than make operations to  Solve this input and give this as output to user 

--------------------

How we make this ? 

The computer has not Mind as we have but he has Transistor !! 

ex as  : 

![2022-11-08 (1)](C:\Users\49157\OneDrive\الصور\Screenshots\2022-11-08 (1).png)

transistor has unit >> bit =  once 0  once 1 

Byte is 8 transistors :  bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit 

​					on =	bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit 

​								1  1   1   1   1   1   1   1

​						

​					off =	bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit 

​								 0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0



EX :

each Letter in English has value from 0 or 1 in computer language 

also images or videos and music  have value as letter

###                        

## Binary System  :

![2022-11-08 (5)](C:\Users\49157\OneDrive\الصور\Screenshots\2022-11-08 (5).png)

 

number s in Binary System :

128    64    32     16   8   4   2  1             

ex :  i will write 100 in computer   when i this write this is :

128    64    32     16    8    4    2   1  

  0	   1	  1		0	0    1    0   0      >>> 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0

111 to binary  :         128    64    32     16   8   4   2  1    

​									0      1      1       0    1   1   1   1

Scientists have this  of binary  to can our computer understand what we will from him and that are of all data from us to machine (computer)

- ## first one was the  ASCII code >  American standard information interchange 

![2022-11-09 (2)](C:\Users\49157\OneDrive\الصور\Screenshots\2022-11-09 (2).png)

that means when we write Ex : Hello  are just zeros and ones 

![2022-11-09 (3)](E:\2022-11-09 (3).png)

this is good but not  enough because we have just 7 values and with this can we another language not using or store with our binary 

![2022-11-09 (4)](E:\2022-11-09 (4).png)

also not  enough when have 8 values from binary  

![2022-11-09 (5)](E:\2022-11-09 (5).png)

for that we have >>>

- ## second was Uni_code

  ## Colour : how can computer  this understand >> like this 

  our colour are from mix the three colour red green blue  and each once has height value : 255

## Algorithms

what is : it is that you have problem and you  search  of best solve for this problem  >> steps to the solve our problems 

- step1

- step2

- step3

- step4

  solving  

Ex :  

2+2+2 = 6 ,but when i will  add 2 more this values what i can doing ?!

i have two way  : 

1- take the result and add of him my new value :

6+2 = 8

2- make this from first with add the new value :

2+2+2+2 = 8 

like this we have our needs but the first solution is better than the second and more quickly  and that what we need or for this use Algorithms 

 ex : 

i will call my wife but i have  the number in numbers book 

- first algorithm that i open the book and search one site one site ex 4500 step ,but is not easy and need more time 
- second algorithm that i open the book two site to site and with this can i more quickly find what i need , 2250 step   but this not the best solution 
- third  that i open the book from half and see if my  target of the left or the right in the book and make this until I find my goal or target  like this : i have 4500 site but with this algorithm can i abbreviation my steps to 2250 and with one more loop can i to 1125 steps  and with one more can i to just  562 steps  , like how is easy with just  3 steps i have  !!!!!!

Now  our question is what is the relation between algorithms  and programmes ?!

we need Know that computer has not mined that mean that he need from us this info to make what we will and when is not enough can he not good that he can not  alone working that he has not mind 

![2022-11-09 (12)](C:\Users\49157\OneDrive\الصور\Screenshots\2022-11-09 (12).png)

computer need from us tell him what we need that mean steps and steps are algorithms 

### Pseudocode : steps for our apps to working  

steps1 

steps2

steps3

steps4

steps5

steps6
